    <h1>HTML basic tags 1</h1>
    <h3>
        This is header "&lt;h3&gt;" "&lt;/h3&gt;"  tag it has total 5 size from h1 to h5
    </h3>
    <p>
        This is paragraph tag here we can write paragraphs "&lt;p&gt;" "&lt;/p&gt;" , but it does not support next line and random new line space 
        tag like below also not extra space in between the character

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        but if we use "&lt;br&gt;"  tag it will help us to use nextline like this but extra space we cannot get with "&lt;br&gt;"  tag
        <br>
        name:      sharad

    <pre>let's say we need lots of new line and empty space with new line then we can use "&lt;pre&gt;"  "&lt;/pre&gt;"  tag

        above are the blank space with new line and extra space's 
    </pre>
    <pre>
        There are more tags which will help to manage basic things in paragraphs for example, I want to bold some word or sentence like this <b> "&lt;b&gt;"  "&lt;/b&gt;"  tag</b>
        we can also use "&lt;i&gt;" "&lt;/i&gt;" tag to make <i>italian font.</i> 
        just as "&lt;b&gt;"  "&lt;/b&gt;" and "&lt;i&gt;" "&lt;/i&gt;" we have <strong> "&lt;strong&gt;" "&lt;/strong&gt;" </strong> and <em> "&lt;em&gt;" "&lt;/em&gt;" </em>
        this are for blind people there are some ways which speaks the sentence which helpful for blind people or we case the system is reading
        so we have more tags which is usefull like below:-
        "&lt;mark&gt;" "&lt;/mark&gt;" :- <mark>for highlighting </mark>
        "&lt;ins&gt;" "&lt;/ins&gt;" :- <ins>for underlining </ins>
        "&lt;del&gt;" "&lt;/del&gt;" :- <del>for cut the letters </del>
        "&lt;small&gt;" "&lt;/small&gt;" :- <small>for small letter </small>
        there are some tags for scientific notation like
        "&lt;sup&gt;" "&lt;/sup&gt;" :- for keep "raise to" 10<sup>2</sup>
        "&lt;sub&gt;" "&lt;/sub&gt;" :- for keep  "below the letters" H<sub>2</sub>
    </pre>
    <pre>
        we also have citation which is nothing but taking some infomation and adding the link of that infomation source like below
        this will not have the clickable link it is just for reference for us
        <blockquote cite="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">
            HTML is the standard markup language for Web pages. With HTML you can create your own Website.
        </blockquote>
        "&lt;blockquote&gt;" "&lt;/blockquote&gt;" 
        "&lt;q&gt;" "&lt;/q&gt;" :- this is to qoute something <q>this is qoute</q> note that this is different then this qoutes ""
